        <h1>Exploring the Environment in the US Through Data</h1> 
        <p>This report explores three different areas of the environment in the United States: air, food, and energy. 
            These three areas not only encompass essential issues that must be addressed in the fight against climate change, they also affect the lives of Americans every single day.
            From the air that we breathe to the food that we eat to the energy that powers our lives, Americans must seek to address every aspect of how we live to work towards a greener future.
            Each section will contain a paragraph describing data in each area and a report with several visualizations showing the data.
        </p>

        <h3>Air in the United States</h3> 
        <p>This section explores historical trends in air pollution, prominent sources of air pollution, and areas in the US that are currently not meeting National Ambient Air Quality Standards. 
            Through these three sets of data, we can see how air pollution has shifted over time to get a context for the current issues facing air quality in the US.</p>
            <p>
            As evidenced by the first graph, air pollutants have steadily decreased since 1990, but there is still more work to be done. 
            Next, the data regarding the prominent sources of air pollution can help us identify which pollutants are the most prevalent and the most damaging. 
            Finally, looking at the data regarding the areas in the US that are not meeting National Ambient Air Quality Standards, we can see which communities are suffering the most from bad air quality and require the most intervention.

        <h3>Food in the United States</h3> 
        <p>This section explores food insecurity, agriculture and greenhouse gas emissions, and the supply chain and greenhouse gas emissions. 
            These three sets of data demonstrate how societal issues around food are also linked to a worsening climate.</p>
            <p>
            In the first graph, we see that food insecurity peaked around the year 2010 before falling until 2021. In 2022, however, we see a sharp rise in food insecurity, which has reversed the positive trend and should be an area of significant concern. 
            Next, we see how different agricultural sectors contribute to climate change. This can help us identify areas that could see the greatest reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, which can help us balance creating more sustainable agricultural systems with supporting American food production. 
            Finally, in the third graph, we see how much different steps in America's food supply chain contribute to climate change. Like the previous graph, this can help us identify areas with the greatest potential for greenhouse gas reductions. As we can see in this graph, primary production of food is responsible for almost 50% of emissions from the US food system, highlighting a potential opportunity to increase sustainability.

        <h3>Energy in the United States</h3> 
        <p>This section explores energy trends by source, energy consumed by sector, and energy consumed by source. 
            Energy is one of the biggest emmitters of greenhouse gases, but it is also essential to almost every aspect of life in the modern world. Balancing energy needs with an increased investment in renewable and green energies will be essential to creating a just transition to clean energy.</p>
            <p>
            The first graph on the first page shows the percentage of energy produced by three carbon-producing sources of energy alongside the percentage produced by zero-carbon sources. The second graph on that page shows the total warming potential of the three carbon-producing sources from the first graph. As we can see, the percentage of energy being generated by zero-carbon sources of energy continues to rise, and the emissions produced by carbon-producing sources of energy has been steadily declining since the mid-2000s, but there is still significant process to be made before we can reach a fully zero-carbon energy system. 
            Next, we see data showing the amount of energy consumed by three main sectors, commercial, residential, and industrial. Unfortunately, consumption from all three sectors has grown steadily since the 1950s, and each must find ways to become more sustainable moving forward.
            Lastly, we see a graph of energy consumption based on which zero-carbon energy it was produced by. As we can see by the graph, the number of zero-carbon energy sources has increased significantly since the 1950s, which is a promising sign.
